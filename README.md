# Claude Scholar

**Language**: [English](README.md) | [中文](README.zh-CN.md)

A comprehensive Claude Code configuration for data science, AI research, and academic writing.

## Introduction

Claude Scholar is a production-ready configuration system for Claude Code CLI, optimized for researchers, data scientists, and ML engineers. It provides skills, commands, agents, and hooks that streamline the complete research workflow—from idea to publication.

## Core Workflows

### 1. Automated Enforcement Workflow

Cross-platform hooks (Node.js) automate workflow enforcement:

```
Session Start → Skill Evaluation → Session End → Session Stop
```

- **skill-forced-eval** (`skill-forced-eval.js`): Before EVERY user prompt → dynamically scans all available skills (local + plugins) → forces evaluation of each skill → requires activation before implementation → ensures no relevant skill is missed
- **session-start** (`session-start.js`): Session begins → displays Git status, pending todos, available commands, package manager → shows project context at a glance
- **session-summary** (`session-summary.js`): Session ends → generates comprehensive work log → summarizes all changes made → provides smart recommendations for next steps
- **stop-summary** (`stop-summary.js`): Session stops → quick status check → detects temporary files → shows actionable cleanup suggestions

**Cross-platform**: All hooks use Node.js (not shell scripts) ensuring Windows/macOS/Linux compatibility.

### 2. Paper Writing Workflow

Complete lifecycle from idea to publication:

```
Template Preparation → Writing → Anti-AI → Submission → Rebuttal
```

- **Template Prep** (`latex-conference-template-organizer`): Download official conference template .zip files → skill extracts main files, removes sample content → outputs clean template structure ready for Overleaf
- **Writing** (`ml-paper-writing`): Systematic guidance from research repository to final draft → includes narrative framing, abstract formulas (5-sentence), literature search with citation verification, section-by-section drafting with feedback cycles
- **Anti-AI** (`writing-anti-ai`): Pattern detection removes inflated symbolism, promotional language, vague attributions → adds human voice and varied rhythm → supports English and Chinese
- **Submission**: Conference-specific checklists (NeurIPS 16-item, ICML Broader Impact, ICLR LLM disclosure) and page limit enforcement
- **Rebuttal**: Strategies from paper-miner knowledge base → extracted from successful conference rebuttals → addresses technical questions and additional experiment requests

### 3. Code Organization Workflow

Maintainable ML project structure:

```
Project Structure → Code Style → Debug → Git Workflow
```

- **Structure** (`architecture-design`): Factory & Registry patterns for module instantiation → config-driven models accept only `cfg` parameter → enforced by `rules/coding-style.md`
- **Style** (enforced by `code-reviewer` agent): 200-400 line files maximum → type hints required → `@dataclass(frozen=True)` for configs → functions split before 4-level nesting
- **Debug** (`bug-detective`): Systematic error detection for Python, Bash/Zsh, JavaScript/TypeScript → error pattern matching → stack trace analysis → common anti-pattern identification
- **Git** (`git-workflow`): Conventional Commits format (`feat/scope: message`) → branch strategy (master/develop/feature) → merge with `--no-ff` → rebase for syncing upstream changes

### 4. Skill Evolution System

3-step continuous improvement cycle:

```
skill-development → skill-quality-reviewer → skill-improver
```

1. **Develop** (`skill-development`): Create skills with proper YAML frontmatter → clear descriptions with trigger phrases → progressive disclosure (lean SKILL.md, details in `references/`)
2. **Review** (`skill-quality-reviewer`): 4-dimension quality assessment → Description Quality (25%), Content Organization (30%), Writing Style (20%), Structural Integrity (25%) → generates improvement plan with prioritized fixes
3. **Improve** (`skill-improver`): Merges suggested changes → updates documentation → iterates on feedback → reads improvement plans and applies changes automatically

### 5. Knowledge Extraction Workflow

Two specialized mining agents continuously extract knowledge to improve skills:

- **paper-miner** (agent): Analyze research papers (PDF/DOCX/arXiv links) → extracts writing patterns, structure insights, venue requirements, rebuttal strategies → updates `ml-paper-writing/references/knowledge/` with categorized entries (structure.md, writing-techniques.md, submission-guides.md, review-response.md)
- **kaggle-miner** (agent): Study winning Kaggle competition solutions → extracts engineering best practices, data processing pipelines, model architecture patterns → feeds insights into `architecture-design`, `bug-detective`, and related development skills

**Knowledge feedback loop**: Each paper or solution analyzed enriches the knowledge base, creating a self-improving system that evolves with your research.

### Requirements

- Claude Code CLI
- Git
- (Optional) Node.js (for hooks)
- (Optional) uv, Python (for Python development)

### First Run

After installation, the hooks provide automated workflow assistance:

1. **Every prompt** triggers `skill-forced-eval` → ensures applicable skills are considered
2. **Session starts** with `session-start` → displays project context
3. **Sessions end** with `session-summary` → generates work log with recommendations
4. **Session stops** with `stop-summary` → provides status check

## Project Rules

### Coding Style

Enforced by `rules/coding-style.md`:
- **File Size**: 200-400 lines maximum
- **Immutability**: Use `@dataclass(frozen=True)` for configs
- **Type Hints**: Required for all functions
- **Patterns**: Factory & Registry for all modules
- **Config-Driven**: Models accept only `cfg` parameter

### Agent Orchestration

Defined in `rules/agents.md`:
- Available agent types and purposes
- Parallel task execution
- Multi-perspective analysis
